This is a prototype of a game concept were the player flies and performs tricks during the avoidance of objects. The player gains points for tricks and tickcombos he performs without getting hit by an object. The objects vary in size, some are small and hard to see (sword) others are gigantic (pillars) and hard to avoid. If the player hits an object he looses the trick points that weren't added to the score, also the multiplier gets resetted.
The Goal is to get as many points as possible before the song ends.
