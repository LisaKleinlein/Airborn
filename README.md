Variables to play with in Development (can change with the development):

In the BP_ThirdPersonCharacter: zoomMultiplier: changes the speed in which the player can zoom in or out
                                MovementSpeed: changes the speed of the movement of the player
                                
In the Windtunnel Blueprint: RangeX, RangeY and RangeZ: changes the dimensions of the Windtunnel 
                             DistanceBetweenForceLines: The Blueprint works with raytracing and this variable determines how close the traces are and how many of them                                                           are there. A low number results in more traces and more computing power.
                             MaxForce: The strength of the "wind" that blows the player into the air.
